Files:
- index.html
- styles.css

How to view locally:
- Open index.html in your web browser.

How to host publicly (quick options):
1) GitHub Pages (free)
   - Create a GitHub repository (public).
   - Upload these files to the repository root (index.html at root).
   - In repository Settings -> Pages -> set branch to main and root folder -> Save.
   - Your site will be published at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name> within a few minutes.

2) Netlify (free tier for simple static sites)
   - Create a Netlify account, drag-and-drop the zip or connect your GitHub repo, and publish.

3) Vercel (free for static frontends)
   - Create Vercel account and import your GitHub repo, then deploy.

4) Other: Firebase Hosting, Surge.sh, or any static web hosting provider.

If you want, I can:
- Modify the content (add images, additional pages like 'Laws by clause', or a printable PDF).
- Prepare a ready-to-push GitHub repo (I can create the files; you'll need to push them to your GitHub).
- Provide step-by-step screenshots for GitHub Pages deployment.
